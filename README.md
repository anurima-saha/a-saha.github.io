##### ***APPLICATION & VALUE***
The data collection in this NASA website looks something like this:

We can see a wide collection ranging from population to food supply, from environmental performance indicator to census related archives, from climate risk to sustainablity and so on. Data from this website will be exteremely useful for any analysis involving impact of climate change and initiatives on sustainablity.
Following [the Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement) by United Nations this field has become the focus for countries and industries alike, with major implications especially for finance and tech industries. So, for a person like me who is motivated to work on "Business Risk and Climate Analysis" this data holds a lot of significance.
